# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System

## Project Description

### Goal

The goal of the project is creating the documentation for the functional safety of a Lane Assistance system based on [ISO 26262: Road vehicles - Functional safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262 "ISO 26262: Road vehicles - Functional safety"). ISO 26262 is an international standard for functional safety on electrical and/or electronic system in production automobiles defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 2011. The Lane Assistance system is part of a Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) with the following functionalities:

- Lane departure warning:When the car departs a lane without using a turn signal the system will vibrate the steering wheel to warn the driver.
- Lane keeping assistance: When the car departs a lane without using a turn signal the system will move the steering wheel back towards the lane center.

### Project Files

Project consists following documents:
- [SafetyPlan](01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Hazard Analysis And Risk Assessment](02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.pdf)
- [Functional Safety Concept](03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Technical Safety Concept](04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.pdf)
- [Software Requirements And Architecture](05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.pdf)

## Project Description from original
Your job will be to create functional safety documents based on what you learned in the lessons. These documents are simplified versions of what a functional safety manager would create as part of a safety case. A safety case is a collection of documents proving that a project has made a vehicle safer.


### Description of Repo Files

This repo contains all the files to complete the car nanodegree functional safety project. We are also providing the same files in a google drive folder. Here is the link to the Google Drive folder: [Link to templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByaZfGJuntGTQWRpNUpuNVVGNlU)


The repo contains a PDF file called **Project_Instructions.pdf**. This document gives information about how to approach the project and what is expected. You'll also see a project template folder. There are five files in the folder. You should use these templates to develop your solution:


* 01_SafetyPlan_LaneAssistance.doc

* 02_HazardAnalysisAndRiskAssessment.xlsx

* 03_FunctionalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.doc

* 04_TechnicalSafetyConcept_LaneAssistance.doc

* 05_SoftwareRequirementsAndArchitecture_LaneAssistance.doc

You will need to fill out all five of these documents in order to meet specifications.  

The repo also contains an Architecture_Diagrams folder containing visuals that you will need to complete the reports. These visuals are in no particular order, and you will decide in which document or documents they belong.


### Project Rubric
You can find the project rubric in the classroom. 


### Software

To complete the project, you will need a word processor and spreadsheet software.

If you do not have word processing software on your local computer, we suggest using [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) or [Microsoft Office in the Cloud](https://www.office.com/). Both of these services are free. 

There are also open source word processors such as [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/]) and [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org).


### Submitting
For your project submission, please export your work into pdf files. This will ensure that reviewers can review your work no matter what word processing and spreadsheet software you used.
